# Coinector - Coinnect the coimunity

This app provides a horizontally and vertically scrollable list of card items containing all merchants accepting BCH or DASH payments worldwide.

It provides a search action (top right action bar), which lets the user search for various tags, locations, brands or common phrases.

On the card of each merchant the user can tap 2 different action buttons to VISIT or REVIEW the shop.

## VISIT

After tapping the visit button on the card the user is being forwarded to the Google Maps app and from there he can get directions/phone.

## REVIEW

On each card there is a REVIEW button which forwards the user to a website which opens the review action for Google Maps, so that users can give reviews easily and smooth after visiting and consuming with bitcoins.
