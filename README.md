# Coinector - Coinnect the coimunity

This app provides a horizontally and vertically scrollable list of card items containing all Restaurants, Bars, Supermarkets, Hotels, Shops & Spas accepting BCH or DASH payments worldwide.

It provides a search action (top right action bar), which lets the user search for various tags, locations, brands or common phrases.

On the card of each merchant the user can tap 2 different action buttons to VISIT or REVIEW the shop.

## VISIT

After tapping the visit button on the card the user is being forwarded to the Google Maps app and from there he can get directions/phone.

## REVIEW

On each card there is a REVIEW button which forwards the user to a website which opens the review action for Google Maps, so that users can give reviews easily and smooth after visiting and consuming with bitcoins. 

## MAP

The app features a native Google Maps view with markers in different colors according to their category.

## ADD PLACES

1. The user who sends an Email to add a place, triggers an automated action, which creates an Issue on Gitlab & Github:
https://gitlab.com/bmap.cash/bmap.cash/issues & https://github.com/theRealBitcoinClub/bmap.cash/issues
2. Places can be updated via Github repository, they are sorted by continent and can be broken down in finer groups if necessary as the database grows:
https://github.com/theRealBitcoinClub/flutter_coinector/tree/master/assets
3. Images must be added to the main repo of bmap.cash in GIF format 640x480:
